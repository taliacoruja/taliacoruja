## Hi there 💻 I'm Talia

I'm a **Front-End Developer** focused on building clean, accessible, and well-structured user interfaces.  
I work with Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS architecture, and a11y to create reliable, maintainable front-end solutions for real-world products.

Currently expanding my skill set by **learning React** and modern React patterns, with a focus on component architecture, state management, and accessibility.

My experience includes enterprise applications in education, healthcare, and online services, where clarity, scalability, and user comfort are essential.
